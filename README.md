# Open Source Personal Blog Page Code

Hello! This is my open-source personal Blog page code. It currently operates with Express.js and EJS (I intend to switch it to Jade as soon as possible). At the moment, it lacks an admin panel, so you'll need to manually input blogs and upload them. However, there's a blog model in place that allows you to post new blogs by making minor modifications to the code. Personally, I utilize it with my own admin panel, but unfortunately, I can't share its code due to security concerns. Nevertheless, I aim to make this code open-source, hoping that others might use it in their projects. I'd gladly accept any community contributions, which I can merge into the main branch.

## Features

- It uses Markdown files for blogs, allowing manual adjustments when necessary.
- The integration with MongoDB makes it easy to connect with any panel that utilizes MongoDB as well.
- It boasts a responsive design (I'll soon add features like a customizable color palette).

## Shortcomings

- The absence of a built-in panel requires either creating one or utilizing an existing panel.
- Currently, it lacks dynamic link settings; each blog is linked solely through its _id.

This code is still a work in progress. Feel free to use it, and any suggestions for improvements in the main code are greatly appreciated. You can reach out to me via or my email, both of which I'll share below.
